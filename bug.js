In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't updating in Realtime Database despite successful write operations.  The client-side code showed confirmation of successful writes, but the database remained unchanged. I checked the rules and they were correctly permissive. The problem was subtle: I was using a nested object and only updating a property within that object. My original update method was not replacing the entire nested object; it was only merging the updated property which was not updating in the database because of the way Firebase's update function works with nested objects.
